### MAIN OBJECTIVE 
- Identifying high and low performing companies from an ESG perspective.
- Investigating which ESG pillars (Environmental, Social, Governance) most strongly correlate with financial success.
- Recognizing industry or regional patterns in ESG scores and performance metrics.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

The company exhibits a moderate ESG score of 54.6, lagging behind top performing industries like Finance and Technology (scoring 70), which correlates with a lower profit margin of 10.9% compared to high ESG performers (16.7%). Revenue distribution is heavily skewed toward Europe (10B), with minimal contributions from regions like Africa and the Middle East (<2B each), indicating market penetration issues. 

Additionally, the growth rate has declined from a peak of 5.4% in 2019 to 4.2% in 2025, reflecting inconsistent financial performance. This combination of suboptimal ESG performance, regional disparities, and stagnating growth limits the company’s profitability, investor appeal, and long-term sustainability in a competitive market increasingly driven by ESG considerations.

### AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

#### Aim:
To enhance the company’s ESG performance, profitability, and market presence by leveraging data driven insights, thereby ensuring sustainable growth and increased investor confidence by 2027.


#### Objectives:  

- Improve ESG Performance:  
Increase the average ESG score from 54.6 to at least 70 within two years by focusing on environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and governance transparency, aligning with top performing industries like Finance and Technology.

- Boost Profitability:  
Raise the profit margin from 10.9% to 15% by adopting practices of high ESG performers, as they demonstrate a profit margin of 16.7%, through targeted ESG improvements and operational efficiencies.

- Expand Market Presence in Underperforming Regions:  
Increase revenue contributions from Africa and the Middle East from under 2M to at least 4M each by 2027, by implementing region-specific ESG initiatives and marketing strategies to enhance brand reputation and consumer trust.

- Stabilize and Enhance Growth Rates:  
Achieve a consistent annual growth rate of at least 5% by 2027, reversing the decline from 5.4% (2019) to 4.2% (2025), through strategic investments in high ESG industries and regions with growth potential like Asia and Latin America.

- Attract Investor Confidence: 
Position the company as a leader in ESG performance by showcasing improved scores, profitability, and regional expansion, thereby attracting sustainable investments and partnerships with high ESG-performing firms in Technology and Healthcare.

### METHODOLOGY 

#### Cleaning Process 

- Looked for duplicate in which none was found 
- Standardized all text columns 
- Checked for blanks and discovered blank cells in the growth rate column for year 2015 and filled cells with zero 
- Formatted row 1 to be bolder than the rest rows 
- Calculated the esg column using the IF FUNCTION
- Calculated the company count column using COUNT IF
- Put the dataset in a table form

### ANALYSIS 

In order to define how ESG factors relate to company financials the following analysis was carried out 

#### Average ESG Score By Industry 

- Purpose: To analyze which industries have higher or lower average esg performance 

- Calculation: Grouped industry by esg score on a pivot table and represented using a bar chart 


#### ESG Impact On Revenue 

- Purpose: To understand if companies with high esg score have better revenue growth 

- Calculation: Compared average revenue growth of high esg performers (ESG Score>75) vs low esg performers (ESG Score <75)


#### ESG Score Over Time

- Purpose: To evaluate esg improvement or not over time

- Calculation: Industries esg score shown over the year, represented with a line chart 


#### ESG Pillars by Industry 

- Purpose: To show which ESG pillar is contributing to the score 

- Calculation: Show industry by esg pillars and represented using stacked bar chart 


#### Region By Revenue 

- Purpose: Show which region is generate the most revenue 

- Calculation: Show revenue by region represented in a bar chart

### FINDINGS

#### Detecting Issues with Performance

- ESG Impact on Revenue: The pie chart shows $8225.6M in revenue from high ESG performers versus $4253.0M from low ESG performers. This indicates a significant portion of revenue (65.7%) is tied to companies with higher ESG scores, which could pose risks due to increasing regulatory and consumer focus on sustainability.

- Profit Margin Variability: The profit margin of 10.9% is shown, but the "Average ESG Pillar by Industry" bar chart reveals disparities. Industries like Energy and Manufacturing have lower ESG scores (below 50), particularly in Environmental and Social pillars, which may signal operational inefficiencies or reputational risks affecting profitability.

- Regional Disparities: The "Total Revenue by Region" chart shows Europe leading at 10B, while regions like Middle East and Oceania lag (0.8B each). The "ESG Score Over Time for Each Region" line graph indicates North America and Europe have higher and more stable ESG scores (60-70), while Latin America and Asia show lower scores (40-50), suggesting underperformance in ESG adoption in these regions.

#### Highlighting Growth Potential

- Rising ESG Trends: The "ESG Score Over Time for Each Region" shows a gradual upward trend in ESG scores across all regions from 2015 to 2025, with North America and Europe leading. This indicates growing awareness and adoption of ESG practices, presenting opportunities for growth in regions catching up, like Asia and Latin America.

- Revenue Growth in High ESG Performers: Although currently smaller, the $4253.0M revenue from low ESG performers signals a growing market segment. As consumer and investor preferences shift toward sustainability, this segment is likely to expand.

### RECOMMENDATIONS 

#### Recommendations for Investors and Stakeholders

- Diversify Revenue Sources: Reduce reliance on low ESG performers ($4253.0M) by investing in companies with higher ESG scores, particularly in Finance and Technology, to mitigate risks and align with market trends.

- Focus on High-Growth Regions: Prioritize investments in North America and Europe, where ESG scores are consistently high and stable, ensuring better long-term returns. However, consider strategic investments in Asia and Latin America, where ESG scores are improving, to capture early growth opportunities.

- Monitor Profit Margin Risks: Industries like Energy and Manufacturing, with lower ESG scores, may face future regulatory or market penalties. Push for ESG improvements in these sectors to safeguard profitability.

#### Policy & Strategy Recommendations

##### Suggested Focus Areas for ESG Improvements

- Environmental Pillar in Energy and Manufacturing: The "Average ESG Pillar by Industry" chart shows Energy and Manufacturing lagging in the Environmental pillar (~30-40). Focus on reducing emissions, adopting renewable energy, and improving waste management to boost ESG scores and reduce risks.


- Social Pillar in Consumer Goods and Retail: These industries score lower in the Social pillar (~40-50). Implement better labor practices, enhance supply chain transparency, and improve community engagement to address social concerns

- Regional Focus in Latin America and Asia: These regions have lower ESG scores (~40-50). Develop localized ESG initiatives, such as training programs for sustainable practices and partnerships with local governments to improve governance and compliance.


##### Strategic Investments in Companies with Rising ESG Trends

- Target Finance and Technology Sectors: These industries have the highest ESG scores (~60-70) and are likely to attract more investor interest. Allocate capital to companies in these sectors that demonstrate consistent ESG improvements, particularly those with strong governance practices.

- Invest in Emerging Markets with ESG Growth: Asia and Latin America show improving ESG scores over time. Invest in companies in these regions that are adopting ESG practices, especially in industries like Healthcare and Utilities, which have moderate ESG scores (~50-60) and room for growth.

- Support High ESG Performers: The $4253.0M revenue from low ESG performers is a growing segment. Invest in these companies to capitalize on the increasing demand for sustainable businesses, particularly in North America and Europe, where ESG adoption is more mature.


### CONCLUSION 

By addressing these focus areas and strategically investing in rising ESG trends, stakeholders can enhance performance, reduce risks, and position themselves for long-term growth in a sustainability-driven market.
